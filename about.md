# About

This is a very simple tool to help people decide if they are ready to start working on a new startup idea.

This is not an all-encompassing tool. This is not an official anything. 

This is a few of the basic things I think about when others say *'Hey, I want to make a [website, app, company, etc.] that [makes me rich, face swaps dogs with elephants, etc.]'*.

## Site details

This is a static site built with Jekyll. I used the collections feature in Jekyll to build out and link the flow of the quiz.

If I were to do it again I might do it all with JavaScript instead.
